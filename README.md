# Pawed

Pawed isn't just a website; it's a tail-wagging, treat-munching, fetch-playing experience designed especially for our furry friends. Whether you own  a playful Pomeranian or a suave Shih Tzu, Pawed lets you create a profile that showcases your pet's unique personality, breed, and interests. Upload your best "barktography" (that's dog photography), and let the world know that your pooch is ready for some canine companionship.

This Project primarily has the landing page for a dog dating website named Pawed. It uses basic HTML and CSS and is a playful take on the actual Tinder app.
