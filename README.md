# Pawed

Pawed isn't just a website; it's a tail-wagging, treat-munching, fetch-playing experience designed especially for our furry friends. 

This Project primarily focuses on the landing page for a dog dating website named Pawed. It uses basic HTML and CSS and is a playful take on the actual Tinder app itself. It highlights the different features of the app: when certain buttons are hovered about on the home page, the user is navigated to that particular feature. It also has a register forum for new users.
